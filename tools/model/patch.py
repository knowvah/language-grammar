"""Refine resolved contexts with ``overrides``, ``insert_before`` and ``insert_after``.

See docs/grammar-guide.md, "Refining generated models". Applied by the resolver to every
``layer: diagram`` model after its contexts are expanded: removes, then overrides, then
inserts. Patches are collected from the model and its transitive includes in scope order;
the first declaration of a key wins (the model's own beats an included one).
