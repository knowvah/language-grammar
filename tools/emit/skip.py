"""Entries no emitter can express: ``reject`` entries and ``join`` entries that need a joiner.

* ``reject: true`` entries only make the interpreter fail an attempt (they mirror
  ``CommandExecutionResult.error``); a grammar describes accepted text, so they are dropped.
* A ``multiline`` entry with ``join`` matches several lines joined with U+E100
  (``utils/BlocLines.java:296``). The emitters approximate it by matching ``parts`` against
  one line, but a line never contains U+E100; when every match of ``parts`` must contain it
  (see ``needs_joiner``) the entry can never match and is dropped instead of emitted as
  dead, lookaround-heavy weight.

``needs_joiner`` is deliberately conservative: it answers ``True`` only when U+E100 is a
mandatory element on the path of the Part tree (a ``literal``; a ``seq`` child; every ``alt``
branch; a ``plus`` body; a regex with the character at its top level outside classes and
groups, no top-level ``|`` and no optional quantifier). Anything it cannot prove is kept.
